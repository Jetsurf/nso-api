# pynso
Aims to be an *updated* library to support communicating with Nintendo's Switch Online Service.
This is first and formost a supporting project for [Splatnet/Music Bot](https://github.com/Jetsurf/jet-bot).
Features will be written in need of importance for that project

## TODO
- [ ] Splatoon 2 API Endpoints
- [ ] Animal Crossing New Horizons API Passport Endpoints
- [ ] Logins?
  - Clear with IMINK, strip out supporting code from bot, implement in a way that supports a lib + that project
- [ ] ACNH "Extras" (ingame/chat support? etc)

Under construction, keep checking if interested!
